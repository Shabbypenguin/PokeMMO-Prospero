// The game's "choose a file or folder" dialog (GTK on Linux, which a Switch does not have). A small chooser is drawn over the game with
// OpenGL and driven by the controller and the touch screen: A opens a folder or picks a file, B goes up, X cancels, Y chooses the current
// folder, minus changes the file filter, L/R scroll by pages; a tap picks an entry and a drag scrolls. The game sees the folders it
// can see (isolate-root as "/") and the whole SD card as "/sd".
